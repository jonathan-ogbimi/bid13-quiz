PHP Developer Quiz

Please submit all answers to this quiz by creating a git repository and placing your code into that repository. Then send your submission to careers@bid13.com which should include a link to your git repository and any additional comments you would like to make. 

Question #1: 
We are living in a world where, as developers, AI has become a huge part of our lives. However the current state of LLMs is that they tend to generate very low quality code containing many errors. Rather than ask you to pretend that you do not use LLMs, we ask that you prove to us that you are capable of recognizing and correcting the incorrect output of an LLM. 

As an example I have given ChatGPT 4o the following prompt:
Write a php function for fraud detection which uses the Telesign Phone ID API to check the type of phone number. The function should return true if the number is any of (Valid, Fixed Line, or Mobile), while returning false if the number is any of (Prepaid, Voip, Invalid, Payphone or Restricted).

To which it responded with the following incorrect code: https://termbin.com/sq4u (I am unsure if you will get the same output as I did so I am providing here the code you should analyze, rather than whatever output you personally receive from ChatGPT). 

We ask you to review this code, and the Telesign API docs to identify the issues. If needed you can sign up to Telesign for a free account to obtain an API key for testing. Your answer should be functioning PHP code, with comments on the lines that you modified and your reason for modifying them.

Question #2:PHP Quiz Question #2(download this and save it as a CSV)
Write a small php program that will load this CSV and plot the output as a scatter plot. Do not submit the resulting plot or any images of the plot, just submit the code needed to generate it. Then review the data and tell me what conclusions you can make about it.
